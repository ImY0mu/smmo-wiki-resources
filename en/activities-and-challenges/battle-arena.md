# Battle Arena

## Introduction

The Battle Arena is PvE-oriented where you fight randomly generated NPCs relative to the location you are currently in to gain experience in exchange for a certain amount of gold and 1 energy point. Guild Experience can also be earned from the Battle Arena, which is covered more in the [Guild](/wiki/community-and-competition/guilds) guide.

## Location

The Battle Arena can be found by clicking the Battle icon, and afterwards selecting the Battle NPCs (PvE) button.

## Your Tier

The Battle Arena is divided into 11 Tiers. Each tier has a certain Estimated EXP, EXP Modifier, Competition Requirement and Enemy Cost. The enemy cost scales with your level until it hits the max enemy cost. Hitting the completion requirement in a tier unlocks the next tier (except Nirvana) and unlocks the completion chest for that arena.

> [!Note]
> The Estimated EXP gained from Battle Arena is calculated using your current level and the EXP Modifier of the Tier you are in.

> [!Tip]
> You can always go back to lower tiers if you deem your tier's Enemy Cost too expensive, the Enemy Cost stays constant throughout your progression in the game.

## Tier Leaderboards

Each Tier has its own Daily, Weekly, Monthly and All-time Leaderboards. The first three leaderboards refresh at the end of each of their periods and rewards are distributed. The table below showcases the Diamonds earned by the top 5 players in each Tier and Leaderboard.

<div class="table-container">

| Leaderboard | First | Second | Third | Fourth | Fifth |
| ----------- | :---: | :----: | :---: | :----: | :---: |
| Daily       |   1   |   1    |   1   |   0    |   0   |
| Weekly      |  10   |   5    |   3   |   0    |   0   |
| Monthly     |  50   |   25   |  15   |   10   |   5   |

</div>

> [!Note]
> Placement on each of the leaderboards at the same time is possible. **Eg.** You can win the Daily Leaderboard as well as the Weekly Leaderboard at the end of the reset period for both those periods if you place anywhere in the top 3 of both Leaderboards.
