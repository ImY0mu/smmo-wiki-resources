# World Bosses


## Introduction
World Bosses are **extremely** strong non-player opponents that require the teamwork of multiple players to defeat. They spawn every Monday at 12 PM London Time (GMT+1) and have a timer indicating when they will be attackable.

In order to qualify for the experience and items of the Boss, you will need to hit the Boss at least twice - once before its death and once after. If you help defeat a World Boss, you will recieve experience equivalent to 8x, 12x, or 16x of your current level and an item drop that has the minimum `rare` rarity. It is possible to get a celestial or exotic drop from a World Boss.

Bosses can be attacked by players as long as the Boss has at least 5% health remaining, and the player must not be on 0HP. Using a `special attack` on a World Boss does not consume any `Energy Points`. You are still able to participate in killing a World Boss even if you have an ongoing [profession][1].

## God World Bosses

1 God World Boss and 12 normal World Bosses are generated every week. A God World Boss gives you three times the rewards and three times the chance of recieving a celestial or exotic item drop.
