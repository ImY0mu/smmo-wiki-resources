# Quests


## Introduction
Quests are repeatable tasks that gives gold and experience. Performing a quest requires 1 quest point and the success rate depends on your [dexterity](https://github.com/ImY0mu/smmo-wiki-resources/blob/main/en/character/stats.md). Quests unlock depending on your level and completing a quest gives an additional 0.5x multiplier to gold and experience in all quests. You can also use a knight to complete quests for you.
## Location
Quests can be found by clicking `Quests` in the side bar.
## Knight
The knight is an assignable person that spends quest points for you and gives back gold and experience with a tax. The knight can do any quest no matter the player's dexterity. The knight doesn't get boosted by the quest completion multiplier. The knight can level up according to the amount of experience it receives. Leveling up reduces the knight's taxes and makes the knight do quests quicker.
