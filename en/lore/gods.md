# Gods

## Introduction

Gods are powerful entities that players can worship to receive boosts for 1 hour in exchange for an item with the collectable type. 
> [!Note]
> You can only worship one god at a time every 24 hours or 12 hours if the [membership](https://github.com/ImY0mu/smmo-wiki-resources/blob/main/en/character/membership.md) is active.  
> The collectable required for worship are chosen randomly everyday and cannot exceed the rare rarity.
