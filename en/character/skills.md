# Skills

Each skill has a its own separate level and EXP needed to level up. The appropriate tool needs to be equipped from the inventory in order to gather the related materials and earn EXP for the skill. Common and Uncommon tools may be purchased from Toms Tools in Towns

Material locations may be found while traveling, and will allow gathering of a random amount of material before the location is depleted. Each town may have different encounter rates for each material type.
