# Skills

## Introduction
Skills, introduced in update v7.0, can be found in the stats page and is divided into 6 different categories: Fishing, Woodcutting, Treasure Hunting, Mining, Crafting, and Event Gathering. 

Collection Skills can be found/levelled up by stepping.

Tools are divided into 7 rarities, giving different amounts of materials.
Materials can be Untradable/Tradable at a 50:50 chance for common - legendary rarity, and a 75:25 chance for celestial materials. Each material collected yields 1-2 Guild EXP if the player is stepping in a location with an active guild raid.

## Event Gathering
Event Gathering skill EXP is obtained through gathering materials at any Event Location. The nodes do not require a tool to harvest, and both common and elite event material nodes only yield 2-4 event materials. Event Gathering level does not affect gathering. 

## Crafting

Crafting has a seperate page [here][1].
