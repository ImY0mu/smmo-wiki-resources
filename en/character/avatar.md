# Avatar

## Introduction

Avatars are items which can be equipped as your character in game. Avatar items can drop from stepping, PvP, PvE, chests and world boss and can range from legendary to exotic [rarity][1]. Avatars drop as items in your inventory, where they can be collected and permanently bound to your collection.

Upon creating an account, the user is able to choose from a list of default avatars. During events, avatars may be available as an item in the Event Store. Custom Avatars may be purchased and uploaded through the Diamond Store.

Avatars can be changed from the `Your Character` menu, or the `Collections` tab on the sidebar.

> [!NOTE]
> Collecting an avatar removes it from your inventory and cannot be uncollected.

## Custom Avatars

Custom avatars are avatars uploaded by in game players. They do not appear as drops in game and must be purchased through the `Diamond Store`. This covers only the implementation of an icon that you have the right to use, i.e. you can either make one yourself or commission an artist to make for you.

Adding a custom avatar to your profile costs 150 diamonds for a static avatar, or 200 for an animated avatar, without Diamond Store discounts. Once a custom avatar is approved,they will appear as a celestial rarity avatar item in your inventory, so you may rename, inscribe, or trade the avatar you purchased if you haven't redeemed it through the 'add to collection' function.

Upon buying the item, diamonds will be deducted from your account, and you will receive an upload link through in game chat direct messages from the account **Galahad Creative Administration**, where you are able to upload the avatar file.

## Custom Avatar Upload Rules and Guidelines

Your avatar must be the following to get accepted:

- The avatar must follow all in-game rules. No NSFW, including but not limited to (partial) nudity, excessive blood, gore and violence, and drug references.
- The avatar must be 52x52 pixels or lower.
- You must have full, explicit permission to use the avatar.
- The avatar cannot infringe upon existing copyright or intellectual property under any circumstances.
- The avatarâ€™s background and non-character details such as items and objects can be a max of 2/3rd of the full canvas.
- Backgrounds can not be flat base colours (eg. no solid circles).
- The avatar must fit in-line with the game's pre-existing styling; it should be pixel art.
- The avatar filesize must be less than 80 KB.
- All non-humanoid avatars must have human-like features. For example: a potato with eyes.
- The avatar can not be cut off and has to be a full body or thing. It can be a floating head for example, but it can not be visibly cut off somewhere.
- The avatar must be created at a 1:1 ratio (square). Example: 52x52, 50x50, 32x32, etc.
- Static avatars should be uploaded as a `.png` file, and animated avatars a `.gif` file.

Avatar approvals can take up to 5 working days to get approved. When uploading, include information such as who created the avatar, if it was inspired by any pre-existing characters or concepts, and your right to use the avatar. If an avatar is denied, the diamonds will be refunded to your account.

> [!CAUTION]
> You cannot sell or upload edited pre-existing art, downscaled art, AI generated imagery, or upload copyrighted images without permission. Multiple attempts may result in a warning and possible blacklist.
