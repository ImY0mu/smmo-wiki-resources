# Professions

## Introduction
**Professions** is an idle feature in game, where the player may consume `Energy Points` for gold, profession experience, and player experience. Every energy point spent is equal to 10 minutes of professions. When a profession is active, the player is unable to perform certain actions in game, such as stepping. Profession rewards are calculated at a rate per minute, and if a profession is cancelled, the unused Energy Points will be refunded to the player, while the player will recieve the rewards for the time already completed. 

There are different professions available for the player, which have different stat buffs. Every profession type also has ranks, which can be unlocked through profession levels, and higher ranks will reward players a greater rate of gold and experience per minute of work. Switching a profession will not lose your progress on the previous one chosen. 

The player exp earned through each rank of professions is calculated by the following formula:

```(10 + {user_level}) * {player_experience_modifier}```
<br> The player experience modifier starts at 0.2 and is increased by 0.1 until the highest rank, with 1.9 being the highest modifier.

## Disabled Actions During Professions
When a profession is active, you are unable to:
- Step
- Use quest points
- Battle arena
- Attack another player

All other activities in the game can be performed as usual, including the [World Boss](/activities-and-challenges/world-bosses).
