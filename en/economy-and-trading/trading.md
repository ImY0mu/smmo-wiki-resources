# Trading

## Introduction
Trading is a feature in game which allows players to exchange gold and items, as opposed to sending items or gold directly. The player may choose to add items into the trade from their inventory, or storage.

Two players can set up a direct trade between each other and then put in X amount of items and gold. Once both parties are satisfied with what they will be sending/receiving, they can accept the trade. Once accepted, the items and gold will automatically transfer between each account.

To start a trade, go to the profile of the player you are trading with. From the menu, you are able to view previous trades, or open a new one. For a trade to be completed, both parties involved must confirm and accept. A trade is reverted back to `pending` every time a change is made to the trade. 

> [!NOTE]
> Gold added into the trade comes from the player bank, and not pocket gold. If your bank does not hold enough gold, it will then come out of your equipped gold.

## Trade Limitations
You may only add 10 unique items to a trade, not including gold. The quantity of each item is limitless. 

Untradable items, such as untradable MOEs or materials, cannot be added intro a trade. 

Exchanging gold through trading incurs a 6% gold tax.

> When a trade has been started with you by another player,completed, accepted by another player, or cancelled, you will receive a notification for confirmation.
