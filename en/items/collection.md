# Collection  

Collections is a feature that allows a player to permanently consume an item to display in their collection. Collected items cannot be removed from the collection, with the exception of cards. Customised items (with the exception of avatars) cannot be collected.

You can add items to your collection by going into your inventory, selecting an avatar, collectable, sprite, or item and choosing the option to `Add to Collection.` Chest contents of your current chest can be viewed by clicking the collection category and choosinng `What is this?`.

Finishing an avatar chest rewards the player with diamonds, gold, and player EXP. Diamonds and gold are a fixed amount, while player EXP can be calculated by: `exp_amount * player_level`

> [!NOTE]
> You can collect multiple items at once by using the multi-select feature in your inventory. 

There are 8 different total collection categories:
- Avatars
- Collectables
- Items
- Sprites
- Backgrounds
- Cards
- NPCs
- Events

## Avatar Collection  

In the [avatar][1] section, you are able to equip and customise custom and in game avatars. Clicking on an avatar allows you to:
- Set as avatar (make it your current equipped avatar)
- Add to showcase (indicated by a star on the avatar)
- Add to favourites (pins it to the front of your avatar tab. Favourited avatars are ordered by chronological order of collection and indicated by a heart icon on the avatar.

The avatars collection has two buttons which allow the player to let the game pick a random avatar to equip, which can be selected from any collected avatar or custom avatars only.

## Collectable and Item Collections  
Collectable and item collections have 2 types; unique and total chests. When an item/collectable is collected for the first time, it is added for both chests, but any duplicates will only contribute to the totals chest. 

There are some items which cannot be collected, including customised items, materials, tools, keys, potions, treasure chests and books. Items which are available from NPC stores also cannot be collected, with the exception of collectables bought from the Crazy Merchant [NPC store][2] in The Underworld Location.

## Cards Collection
Cards are collector items obtained from in game events. They can not be collected by consuming the item, but will show as 'collected' in your collection if you are holding the card in your inventory. Cards in your storage will not show as collected.

There are 6 rarity tiers of cards:
- Silver static
- Gold static
- Celestial Static
- Silver Holographic
- Gold Holographic
- Celestial Holographic

Currently there are 3 previous events that feature card drops:
- World Football Cup 2022
- Memory Lane 2023
- Retromania (2024)

The Card Collection tab allows you to filter between `Type`, `Pack`, and if the card has been obtained or not. 

## NPC
NPCs can be 'collected' in your collection by killing the NPC, either through the [battle arena][3] or through [travelling][4]. The NPC must be defeated for it to be counted in the collection. 

Currently, some event locations are no longer available so not all NPCs are obtainable.
