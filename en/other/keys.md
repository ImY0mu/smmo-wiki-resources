# Keys

Keys are items that allow the player to open chests in `Mahol's Hut`. Keys can be found just like any other item but are not marketable, sellable, or tradeable. For chest drop rates, see below.

Gold keys can be acquired through the `Diamond Store`. Bronze and silver keys can be bought from `Mahol's Hut` with gold and can also be [crafted][1] using gatherable materials.

You may exchange 4 bronze keys to 1 silver key in `Mahol's hut`.
