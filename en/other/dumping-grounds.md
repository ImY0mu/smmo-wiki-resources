# Dumping Grounds

The dumping ground is a place where you can dump your items and exchange them for tokens. Rack up the tokens so you can dive in there yourself and see if you can find something amazing!

This place only contains items that other players have thrown in.

> [!TIP]
> To see how many of a specific item is in the dump, click the item tag and the `inspect` button!

**Throw Items** - Each item thrown will provide you with one dumping token.

**Hunt for Items** - Action button which allows you to search the dump once per action. Also consists of an `options dropdown menu` to consume energy points to collecting multiple items at once.

Drop Down Options:

- 10 Items (1 Energy)
- 20 Items (2 Energy)
- 30 Items (3 Energy)

You need **10 Dumping Tokens** to hunt.

Exotic and Celestial [rarity][1] items dumped and pulled from the dump are announced in the in-game global [chat][2], with the exception of food type items.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are a few items cannot be dumped due to being purchasable in [NPC Shops][3], being a specific item category or being an untradable item.
