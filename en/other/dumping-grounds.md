# Dumping Grounds

The dumping ground is a place where you can dump your items and exchange them for tokens. Rack up the tokens so you can dive in there yourself and see if you can find something amazing!

This place only contains items that other players have thrown in.

**Throw Items** - Each item thrown will provide you with one dumping token.

**Hunt for Items** - Action button which starts to search the dump. Also consists of an `options dropdown menu` to use energy for collecting more items at once.

Drop Down Options:

- 10 Items (1 Energy)
- 20 Items (2 Energy)
- 30 Items (3 Energy)

You need **10 Dumping Tokens** to Hunt.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are a few items cannot be dumped due to being purchasable in [NPC Shops][1], a specific item category or being an untradable item.
