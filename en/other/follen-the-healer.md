# Folen the Healer
_You enter the Folen's tent as he is investigating one of his patients. He stops and turns around towards you. He points towards the corner of the room and utters a single word, "Wait".
Refill your health points_

**Refill your Health Points (HP)**

Within the `Town` you can refill your HP to the maximum amount.

You can only refill your HP a **finite** amount of times per day and that amount is dependent on your circumstances.

Regular players can only refill **three** times per day.

[Plebs][1] can refill **six** times per day.

> [!TIP]
> Your health will regenerate to full each time you level up. If you have any remaning health you could step to level up and regenerate due to Folen healing from **any** amount of missing health

Once you have used up all of your Follen heals you will see the following message:

`You have already reached the maximum amount of refills you can do today. Please wait until 12PM (London) to be able to refill your HP again.`
