# Bounties

## Introduction
Bounties are a feature where the player can accept a bounty in order to kill another player for a gold reward. Once a bounty is claimed, it must be completed within 6 hours or you will lose your claim over it. You can only accept one bounty at a time. To unclaim a bounty, click the claimed bounty and click cancel. Placed bounties expire after 30 days if not completed.

The bounty board can be found in the town, where it has 4 tabs:
- Obtainable: Bounties that you are eligible for by PVP criterias and that the targets are not in safe mode.
- All: All listed bounties, that have not been completed.
- Accepted: Bounties you have accepted.
- Listings: Bounties you have placed on another player.

## Placing a Bounty
You can place a bounty on another player in game by going to their profile, going to the bounty menu and inputting the amount of gold you would like to create the bounty reward for. 

There is a 5% gold tax on creating a bounty, and an additional minimum cost based on the players level, which is shown on the popup. You will recieve a notification when the bounty has been completed. If you remove a bounty you have placed, you will not receive the gold you spent creating the bounty. Bounty creation fee is taken from your pocket gold. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not abuse bounty placing in order to target other players.

## Completing a Bounty
To complete a bounty, first you must claim an available bounty from the bounty board. A listed bounty will include the players name, level, gold amount, and the person who listed the bounty.

Once you have claimed a bounty, head to the player's profile and click `attack.` You will recieve the gold automatically in your pocket when you have successfully defeated the player, and a notification confirming the bounty has been completed. 

> [!TIP]
> A quick and easy way to go to a person's profile fom the bounty menu, is to click on the same bounty again and click on their name. 

## Bounty Bot
Throughout the day, SimpleMMO Bot places bounties on inactive players, which can be farmed for gold. 

There is a chance for the bot to place 25-30 bounties at every 5 minute interval. There will only be a chance for this to happen when it has been 20 minutes since the last bounty drop. A drop is guaranteed if 80 minutes has passed since the last drop. 

The bounties listed by the SimpleMMO Bot will be worth 1,000 gold per the target's level, capped at 500,000. This means a bounty on a level 200 player would be worth 200,000, while bounties on a level 500, or 20,000 player, will both be 500,000 gold.
