Defence is sometimes an underrated stat because of the high use of crit gear who has mostly very low defence wich more of the higuer levels didn't need mostly, but it really have a high impact on regular players:
What give you the defence stat? It is a combination of Armor who reduces directly the damage you take from other players or npcs and also give the chance of the enemy to miss attacks
You could ask yourself if this really make a worthy impact enough for you to quit str to invest on defence or byy gear with more defence.
As a pvp enjoyer i can ashure defence is extremely useful being actively playing and also when you go offline (there will be less chances you get killed by lower levels or mabe higher ones with not enough dexterity) Also it helps when you are stabbing and you have to stop less to refill heal for fighting players near your level. (sometimes i have defeated players with 10k more levels just because i have enough defence to make it fail the hits enough) also if you dont like to step much but like pvp defence will be way more worth for you than strength.
