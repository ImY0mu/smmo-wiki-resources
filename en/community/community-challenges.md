# Community Challenges

Community Challenges are large-scale goals shared across all players. Each challenge type is defined by a specific action that must be completed collectively. Progress is tracked globally, and rewards are distributed when thresholds are met.

The goal for each challenge is randomly generated between its minimum and maximum thresholds, then rounded to the nearest thousand.

When the Community Challenge goal is achieved you are able to activate the buff `manually` at any time of gameplay. It does not activate `automatically`.
