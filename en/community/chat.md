# Chat

## Introduction 
SimpleMMO contains an in-game chat with different categories, allowing players to interact and have conversations with each other, advertise their items, and ask questions in game. Sending chat messages may occasionally yield chat diamonds (3-10), player EXP, and common event materials when there is an event ongoing. There is a  cooldown between messages, and you cannot post links in chat.  

## Accessing Chat

## Reporting and Blocking

If there's rule breaking, drama, or anything that makes you uncomfortable, you should not interact with the player and instead block and report them. If the situation cannot be de-escalated, do not talk at all/close chat. This will stop the situation from escalating and allow quicker mod action.

- To report a message, click the menu (3 dots) button on the message and 'report'. In the text box, describe why it breaks the rules.
  - If there is an urgent situation in chat (e.g. bot raid), it is best to make a Discord ticket as mods get pinged for it
- To report a player, create a support ticket in game, on Discord, or go to their profile, dropdown menu (web)/scroll down(app), and report. When making a report, include the context, the situation, the player's username, ID, and other relevant information. If possible, take screenshots to attach as evidence to your discord ticket.


- To block someone, click the menu (3 dots) button on their message and click 'block.' Alternatively, you can go to their profile, use the dropdown menu (web) or scroll down (app) and click block and confirm.
  - Blocking someone stops them from seeing your messages in chat, and you seeing their messages in chat
  - It also prevents player interaction (e.g. waves), and viewing your profile.
  - If you are blocked by someone, respect their decision and move on. Do not attempt to block evade through any means.
