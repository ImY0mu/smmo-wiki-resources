# Chat

## Introduction

SimpleMMO contains an in-game chat with different categories, allowing players to interact and have conversations with each other, advertise their items, and ask questions in game. Sending chat messages may occasionally yield chat diamonds (3-10), player EXP, and common event materials when there is an event ongoing. There is a cooldown between messages, and you cannot post links in chat.

## Accessing Chat

To access chat on web, click the 'Show Chat' button in the bottom right corner.  
To access chat on the SMMO app, click the chat icon in the top right corner, or swipe from the right side of the screen.

## Chat Rooms

The in-game chat contains 4 chat rooms with different intended purposes of usage.

- Global: The main player chat, where players chat.
- Ads: For posting advertisements for your market and player trading. There is a 30 minute posting cooldown. 
- Support: Asking for help and general questions in the game.
- Guild: This chat can only be accessed by your guild members. However, most guilds communicate via Guild Discords.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you need staff help, for example a payment issue, create a ticket on the SMMO Discord, or in the Support tab (left on app, top on web).

## Reporting and Blocking

If there's rule breaking, drama, or anything that makes you uncomfortable, you should not interact with the player and instead block and report them. If the situation cannot be de-escalated, do not talk at all/close chat. This will stop the situation from escalating and allow quicker mod action.

- To report a message, click the menu (3 dots) button on the message and 'report'. In the text box, describe why it breaks the rules.
  - If there is an urgent situation in chat (e.g. bot raid), it is best to make a Discord ticket as mods get pinged for it
- To report a player, create a support ticket in game, on Discord, or go to their profile, dropdown menu (web)/scroll down(app), and report. When making a report, include the context, the situation, the player's username, ID, and other relevant information. If possible, take screenshots to attach as evidence to your discord ticket.

- To block someone, click the menu (3 dots) button on their message and click 'block.' Alternatively, you can go to their profile, use the dropdown menu (web) or scroll down (app) and click block and confirm.
  - Blocking someone stops them from seeing your messages in chat, and you seeing their messages in chat
  - It also prevents player interaction (e.g. waves), and viewing your profile.
  - If you are blocked by someone, respect their decision and move on. Do not attempt to block evade through any means.
