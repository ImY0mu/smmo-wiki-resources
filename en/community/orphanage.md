# Orphanage

## Introduction

The Orphanage is a location in the Town Centre. It can also be accessed from the SimpleMMO home page. Here, players can donate gold or diamonds toward the Daily Orphanage Goal, which is refreshed on the daily reset. Upon completion of each tier, boosts will be activated, which is received by all players for 2 hours. When multiple orphanage tiers are active, the buffs will stack.

Players can donate gold or diamonds to contribute to the orphanage goal. The gold donated from the orphanage will be deducted from your pocket, not your bank. When donating diamonds, one diamond is equivalent to 1 million gold. If a player donates more than (insert x amount) equivalent of gold, a [chat][1] message will appear in global, announcing the donation.

- Recent Donators: the latest gold/diamond donations from the community. Donation is shown in gold/diamonds.
- Top Gold Donators: Players with the highest accumulative total gold donations in all time. Donation is shown in gold.
- Top Diamond Donators: Players with the highest accumulative total diamond donations in all time. Donation is shown in diamonds.
