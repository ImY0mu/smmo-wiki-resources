# Vault

The Vault is a daily code-breaking feature where players work together to guess a shared security code. The code is between 8 and 12 digits long â€” longer codes provide stronger 2-hour boosts when cracked. Since the code is the same for everyone each day, cooperation and sharing guesses with the community are key to solving it faster.

Each player gets a limited number of free guesses:

- 3 guesses (standard).
- 4 guesses (with Pleb membership).

Extra guesses can be purchased:

- Up to 3 more (standard).
- Up to 4 more (Pleb membership).

After reaching the maximum, no further attempts can be made until the next daily reset.

## Vault Bonuses

When the correct code is entered, players receive boosts to all experience categories. These bonuses are randomized each day, with possible values of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 40%.

- BA Exp (NPC)

## Color Indicators

When entering a guess, each digit shows feedback:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green** â€“ Digit is correct and in the right position.
- ðŸ”µ **Blue** â€“ Digit is in the code but in the wrong position.
- ðŸ”´ **Red** â€“ Digit is not in the code.
