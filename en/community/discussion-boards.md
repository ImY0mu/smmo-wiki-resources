# Discussion Boards

The **Discussion Boards** is the game forum. It is accessible from sidebar navigation.

There is a 1500-character limit for each post. Titles of threads are not editable so proofread before you post. Posts themselves may be edited. There is a 1 minute cooldown period when posting in threads.

Posting in the discussion boards awards a random amount of experience that scales with the player's level.

## General etiquette

- No spamming
- No necro-ing (reviving threads more than a month old, with the exception of Suggestions category)
- While old suggestions may be revived, don't bump suggestions similar to ones that have been denied or implemented by voting or replying to them.
- Game rules apply

## Categories

**All discussions** shows all discussion topics.

**General** is for all kinds of discussions that do not belong in the other categories.

**Suggestions** is where players may suggest new game features or improvement to existing features.

> [!Note]
> The suggestions system has been moved to the official SMMO discord server

**Help** is where you may ask for help from fellow players.

**Trade** is for all kinds of player trading activities, including auctions. Joke auctions are no longer allowed due to player abuse.

For efficiency, include the following details if you are holding an auction:

- Item name, stat and rarity
- Base price
- Minimum bid increment
- Deadline

**Roleplay** is as it says, for roleplaying.

**Games and Competitions** is where players may host their own games and giveaways.
