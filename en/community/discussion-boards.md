# Discussion Boards

The **Discussion Boards** is the game forum. It is accessible from sidebar navigation.

There is a 1500-character limit for each post. Titles of threads are not editable so proofread before you post. Posts themselves may be edited. There is a 1 minute cooldown period when posting in threads.

Posting in the discussion boards awards a random amount of experience that scales with the player's level.
